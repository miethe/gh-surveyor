[vkambam2/Red-Hat-Openshift-v.3.11-Installation-on-Baremetal-servers](https://github.ibm.com/vkambam2/Red-Hat-Openshift-v.3.11-Installation-on-Baremetal-servers) | RedHat OpenShift is a Kubernetes platform by RedHat that Empower developers to innovate and ship faster with the leading hybrid cloud, enterprise container platform. OpenShift is a strategic container platform for IBM Cloud Paks, that are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions that give clients an open, faster and more secure way to move core business applications to any cloud. This document focus on planning OpenShift-3.11 deployments on BareMetal Servers, Managed instance etc. To install RedHat OpenShift on Bare Metal server, we may install the Hypervisor on Bare metal server e.g. the Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) layer for optimized usage of Bare metal server (or directly install operating system). After the Hypervisor is installed, we need to install the Red HatÂ® Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system layer, and then comes the RedHat Open Shift installation. | 2020-02-10 | 0
